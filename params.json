{"name":"Multivac-client","body":"# multivac client\r\n\r\nThis is the terminal client for accessing the multivac server. Multivac\r\nis a simple app for storing tagged snippets of information.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the 10th version of this note-taking app. I rewrite it\r\nprobably once a year. This time the server is written in Clojure, and\r\nthe command-line client is written in Common Lisp since the JVM startup\r\ntime made the Clojure version a little too slow.\r\n\r\nThe name comes from a short story by Isaac Asimov about a computer that\r\neventually collects enough information to recreate the universe:\r\nhttp://www.multivax.com/last_question.html\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n(I usually alias multivac to just \"m\" and multivac add to just \"ma\")\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~ âž” m\r\nUsage: multivac\r\n                [<tag> <tag> <tag>...] - search by tag\r\n                [add <tag,tag...> <body> [-l link]] - add a new item\r\n                [tags] - list your top 20 tags\r\n                [dump] - dump a json stream of all items to stdout\r\n                [-d <item-id>] - delete an item\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Jason Hickner\r\n\r\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.","tagline":"A terminal client for the Multivac note-taking app","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
